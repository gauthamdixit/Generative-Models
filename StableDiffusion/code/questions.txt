Why does classifier free guidance improve performance?

How do I modify the code to include training?
    -training will be computationally impossible for images of 512x512. Can only really train on MNIST dataset with my computer specs.

How does the CLIP transformer model actually work?

To do 1/31:

    - Review ddpm
    - Review style transfer
